# Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

The model is trained on twitter data and classifies sentiments using machine learning techniques. 

The project demonstrates key steps in building an NLP pipeline:
1. Data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, text cleaning)
2. Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression)
3. Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, etc.

Applications:
1. Understanding customer feedback
2. Social media monitoring
3. Product review analysis
4. Opinion mining
